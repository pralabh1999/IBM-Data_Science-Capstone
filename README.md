# Winning Space Race with Data Science

Space Y is a company that provides space travel services. It is trying to figure out the best way to minimise failing of landings, making the rockets reuseable for upcoming missions.

This is a project completed to determine what are the factors that could increase the rate of successful landing outcomes. The data used in this project is collected through SpaceX API and scraped from Wikipedia page of SpaceX missions. 

This project is completed using Data Science Tools such as Python as the programming Language, Jupyter Notebook as IDE and IBM Watson Studio as platform to use these tools.

The detail findings are included in the report that is included in this repository.
